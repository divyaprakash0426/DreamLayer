Luma – Photon

# Task
Create a luma_photon_depth2img node that takes an input image, auto-estimates depth locally (MiDaS), then calls Photon for novel-view output.

# Key deliverables / Acceptance notes
We consider the task complete once the node chains correctly after any LOAD_IMAGE node, saves the MiDaS depth map under outputs/depth/, and includes an inline docstring explaining how to disable depth for debugging; CI must pass with the depth model downloaded during the GitHub Action’s cache-restore step.
